## Inspiration

The inspiration for our chatbot comes from the desire to solve a daily common problem - deciding what to eat. Though it is a simple problem, it is very relatable. Having easy access to a wide range of recipes based on the ingredients available to you and the type of cuisine you're in the mood for will speed up the decision-making process and have you cooking in no time. Out of this desire to help fellow experimental, open-minded food-lovers, Chefs' Mate was born.

## What it does

Chefs' Mate is a messenger chatbot that will generate a list of delicious recipes that a user can make given their ingredients at hand. It takes into account certain user preferences and restrictions such as allergies, diet, and nutritional needs and will produce appropriate options. Chefs' Mate is literally your very own kitchen companion, guiding you along the journey to food heaven.
